Guidelines on running the Java program
* To run the Java program, ensure that you have the latest JDK installed on your PC.

* Go to the command prompt, and use the command cd to take you to where the java file is. For example, if it is in the Downloads folder, you should use the following command: cd Downloads

* Compile your Java file by using the following command prompt: Javac KennethRichards.java

* This will generate a file named KennethRichards.class in the same directory. 

* After compiling, you can run your program with the correct arguments. You need to specify the filename and the scheduling algorithm ("FCFS" or "SJF").

* Your process details file is named processes.txt.

* To use the FCFS algorithm, you will run: java KennethRichards processes.txt FCFS

* Or, for SJF:

java KennethRichards processes.txt SJF



Additional Information

* I have also written a C program but I am not sure if it works.

* Kindly run the C file first and test it out. If it is correct and meets the requirements, you may use it.
